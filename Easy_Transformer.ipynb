Transformer model is currently a state-of-the-art machine translation system that uses self-attention that can learn both short-range and long-range relations and Feedforward Neural Network that enables model parallelism. Comparing to the [Official TensorFlow Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/tutorials/text/transformer), this model requires less understanding of TensorFlow specific functions and avoids reshaping Tensors."
